Sketchup SVG outline plugin
===========================
Fork of [FlightOfIdeas](www.flightofideas.net) Sketchup SVG outline plugin that fixes some bugs that makes it work in the new Sketchup 2015 edition.

The original plugin can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/sketchup-svg-outline-plugin/

The reason I forked this was to fix the use in [Sketchup 2015](http://www.sketchup.com/) and was not able to get in contact with the original author.

Installation
------------
1. Download the latest `.zip` under releases, then change the file ending to `.rbz`
2. Go into the Sketchup **preferences**.
3. Under **Extensions**, click **Install extension** and find the `.rbz` file.
4. Make sure the **FlightsOfIdeasSVG** extension is checked in the list of extensions.
